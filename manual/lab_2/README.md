# README: If and If-Else Statements in C++

## Overview

This repository provides examples and explanations for using `if` and `if-else` statements in C++. Understanding conditional statements is fundamental to programming, as they allow your program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on certain conditions.

## Contents

1. **if Statement**
    - The `if` statement is a fundamental control flow statement that executes a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to true.

    ```cpp
    if (condition) {
        // Code to execute if the condition is true
    }
    ```

2. **if-else Statement**
    - The `if-else` statement extends the `if` statement by providing an alternative code block to execute when the condition is false.

    ```cpp
    if (condition) {
        // Code to execute if the condition is true
    } else {
        // Code to execute if the condition is false
    }
    ```

3. **Nested if Statements**
    - You can nest `if` statements inside each other to create more complex decision-making structures.

    ```cpp
    if (condition1) {
        if (condition2) {
            // Code to execute if both conditions are true
        }
    }
    ```
