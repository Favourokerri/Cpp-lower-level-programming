# C++ Variables README

## Introduction

This README file provides an overview of variables in the C++ programming language. Variables are fundamental components in C++ that allow you to store and manipulate data within your programs. This guide covers the basics of declaring, initializing, and using variables in C++.

## Variable Declaration

In C++, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. Before you can use a variable, you must declare it. The declaration specifies the variable's data type and a unique name.

```cpp
// Syntax: data_type variable_name;
int age; // Declaration of an integer variable named 'age'
```

## Data Types

C++ supports various data types for variables. Some common data types include:

- `int`: Integer data type for whole numbers.
- `double`: Floating-point data type for real numbers.
- `char`: Character data type for single characters.
- `bool`: Boolean data type for true or false values.

```cpp
int num = 42;
double pi = 3.14159;
char grade = 'A';
bool isTrue = true;
```

## Variable Initialization

Variables can be initialized when declared. Initialization assigns an initial value to the variable. Uninitialized variables may contain garbage values.

```cpp
int x = 10; // Initialized with 10
double y = 3.14; // Initialized with 3.14
```

## Scope of Variables

Variables have a scope, which defines where they can be used in the program. Common scopes are:

- **Local Variables**: Declared inside a function and have function-level scope.
- **Global Variables**: Declared outside of any function and have program-level scope.

```cpp
int globalVar = 20; // Global variable

void myFunction() {
    int localVar = 30; // Local variable
}
```

## Constants

In addition to variables, C++ allows you to define constants using the `const` keyword. Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once initialized.

```cpp
const int myConst = 100;
const double pi = 3.14159;
```

## Conclusion

Variables are essential elements in C++ programming, used to store and manipulate data. Understanding data types, variable declaration, initialization, and scoping rules is crucial for writing effective C++ programs. Feel free to explore more advanced topics related to variables, such as pointers and references, as you progress in your C++ journey.
